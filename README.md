# Leafie-Password-Manager
A simple password manager. It's essentially a python script. This is also a test for me to learn Git & GitHub.

# Usage
Install and run. It will bring you to an intuitive (i hope) GUI that will act as your password manager. All of the files are encrypted using the `cryptography` python library.

# Documentation 
(todo)
